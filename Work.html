    <p>Education is important for every one whether we are adults or children.  Child education is very much important as they absorb the basics of everything in their childhood. Child education in our society is important as many of the people do not consider child education as much important that they think by education they can become equal to their elders. Or most the people of the society think that after getting education their children will leave them because they will consider them as illiterate.

        According to survey the literacy rate in Pakistan is very low and illiteracy rate is high. 35% of population in Pakistan is literate and the rest of it are illiterate. We should arrange the education seeking camps so that the people with wrong thoughts about education may came to know about the importance of education.
        
With the era of time, there have been so many advancements that it has gotten difficult for some people to keep up with it. The reason behind this is lack of education. Nowadays, education is the basic and most essential requirement of life. Surely, without it a person is nothing. This shines light open the fact that how necessary it is to educate our kids. If our children are not educated, that means that our future is dark due to illiteracy.

Not only would this effect on the child’s life itself but would effect on the countries stability too. The life, the power and future of a country is in the hands of its children. Furthermore, if children are uneducated, they would not find employment in the future that would cause them to fall in debts which will ultimately lead to an increase in the crime rate. If our children are not educated, then they will have no knowledge of the advancements, they won’t be able to flourish and will be left behind in the race of success. They will fall into depths of depression and start to question their purpose of life. Such condition would push them towards taking drastic steps such as intake of drugs and even suicide! The percentage of drugs addicts and suicide would increase which will lead to fear and chaos.

These all examples reflect light upon the fact that not education our children will lead to downfall of their life and the society too.
        
    <br>    <b> Therefore our prime importance is that every child in india must get primary education as well as secondry education.</b>

        <p>Better health is central to human happiness and well-being. It also makes an important contribution to economic progress, as healthy populations live longer, are more productive, and save more.

Many factors influence health status and a country's ability to provide quality health services for its people. Ministries of health are important actors, but so are other government departments, donor organizations, civil society groups and communities themselves. For example: investments in roads can improve access to health services; inflation targets can constrain health spending; and civil service reform can create opportunities - or limits - to hiring more health workers.

            Samarpan work on 'Health and development' tries to make sense of these complex links. It is concerned with the impact of better health on development and poverty reduction, and conversely, with the impact of development policies on the achievement of health goals. In particular, it aims to build support across government for higher levels of investment in health, and to ensure that health is prioritized within overall economic and development plans. In this context, 'health and development' work supports health policies that respond to the needs of the poorest groups. Samarpan also works with donors to ensure that aid for health is adequate, effective and targeted at priority health problems.

        Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well being. For a healthy life cycle, a person needs to have a balanced diet and has to regularly exercise. One must also live in a proper shelter, take enough sleep and have good hygiene habits. So, how do we ensure that we are doing all the right things to have a good health? Let’s spread the awareness for the importance of health:
The health of all organisms depends on their surrounding or their environment. Our social environment is an important factor in our individual health.
Public cleanliness is important for individual health. Therefore, we must ensure that we collect and clear the garbage regularly. We must also contact an agency who can take the responsibility of clearing the drains. Without this, you could severely affect your health.
We need food for health and for food, we will have to earn money by doing work. For this, the opportunity to do work has to be available. Good economic condition and jobs are, therefore, needed for individual health
We need to be happy in order to be truly healthy. If we mistreat each other and are afraid of each other, we cannot be healthy or happy. Social equality and harmony are important for individual health.

        "Old Age homes are civilization's dumpsites for human beings who it cannot exploit further."
The world’s second most populous nation hosting 1.21 billion people, according to the provisional figures of the 2011 census, has experienced a dramatic demographic transition in the last century, witnessing an explosive growth of the population aged 60 and over, according to government statistics. Due to globalization ,segmentation of families is natural.

The size of the elderly population has risen from 12.1 million in 1901 to 19.8 million in 1951 to 76 million in 2001 to 100+ million in 2015 and official population projections indicate that the number of 60+ in India will increase to 143 million in 2021 and to 198 million in 2030.
By 2050, according to the United Nations Population Division (UNPD), India will host 48 million seniors over the age of 80 and 324 million citizens above 60, a demographic greater than the total U.S. population in 2012.
The boom is largely being ascribed to improved life expectancy outcomes, which have shot up from 40 years in the 1960s to 68.3 years in 2015. While the overall population of India will grow by 40% between 2006 and 2050, the population of those aged 60 and above will increase by 270%.
With the steady increase of old persons the magnitude of their problems is also increasing. Problems manifest in the form of abuse and violence against the elderly.
According to an estimate nearly 40% of senior citizens living with their families are reportedly facing abuse of one kind or another, but only 1 in 6 cases actually comes to light to uphold family honor. Can you imagine that the primary abuser is usually the son followed by the daughter-in-law.
Consider this, out of every 10 elderly couples in India, more than 6 are forced by their children to leave their homes. With no place to go and all hopes lost, the elderly have to resort to old age homes, which do not guarantee first class treatment.

ngo for needy people

So we here at Manav Kartavya aim to make the elderly feel home and we give our best to provide them all the amenities and utilities. Manav Kartavya, a NGO for old age people in Satellite , has taken an initiative to fill their lives with love and comfort. We have developed an old age home in Ahmedabad to support the elderly parents of our nation and to preserve the blessings and warmth overflowing from their loving hearts. Below mentioned are some activities which we provide to the elderly:
Day-to-day living costs and meals
Arranging recreational activities such as Gardening, Exercise like Yoga, Picnics, Spiritual Sessions, Laughing Sessions, Food Festivals, etc.
General health check-up, Essential healthcare, Crucial medicines and Medical accessories.
